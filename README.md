## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a full CRUD application to review different healthcare providers. The user will have the opportunity to report acts of discrimination they've experienced from providers through comments and those comments will be stored in a database and mapped to each provider. The inspiration for this appliaction is that people of color are, statistically, overlooked by providers and experience discrimination in the healthcare industry.

For the backend application, I plan to have two Mongoose models, one for providers and one for comments, and connect them through a referenced relationship.
